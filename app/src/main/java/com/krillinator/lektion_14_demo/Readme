// DEBUGGER //
    Click the 'bug' icon to the right of Play Button

    WHY: Good for when the app closes without throwing an error!
    Take this example: TODO("Some reason")
        THIS WON'T THROW AN ERROR

// Unit-Testing //
    @Test - Annotation, build test

    AssertEquals - IF 4 = 2 + 2
        NOTE - IF NULL works too! Just type Assert and search for null

    Do not forget to change UNIT testing to APP later next to Pixel Emulator (left of play button)
